PoC Demos
===
## Introduction
This repo contains a collection of OpenShift runtime demos. Most of these are based around the **Coolstore** retail web site demo used frequenlty elsewhere in Red Hat.

The aim is to clone these demos and install the script on an OpenShift cluster.

Unless otherwise stated these demos assume cluster admin privileges even though in most cases the developer aspect does not require it.

Each subfolder contains a demo and the scripts required. Some demos will require some additional cluster setup.
